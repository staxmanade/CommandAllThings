Check out the parent [../README](../README.md)

(TODO) - still working on this step.

For now you can copy this folder locally and look at the [sampleProfile.ps1](sampleProfile.ps1) to get started.

### Supports

- [gulpjs](http://gulpjs.com)
- [gruntjs](http://gruntjs.com)
- [jake](https://github.com/mde/jake)
- [rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/)


### But it doesn't have my tool?

What tool do you need added? Take a look at the  [sampleProfile.ps1](sampleProfile.ps1) and see how you could extend it to support another tool. It's simple... Or open an issue and request an addition.
