CommandAllThings - PowerShell
================

### What is this project?

Check out the parent [../README](../README.md)


### Setup

(TODO) - still working on this step.

For now you can copy this folder locally and look at the [sampleProfile.ps1](sampleProfile.ps1) to get started.


### But it doesn't have my tool?

What tool do you need added? Take a look at the  [sampleProfile.ps1](sampleProfile.ps1) and see how you could extend it to support another tool. It's simple... Or open an issue and request an addition.
